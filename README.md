## **Description**

**_Node.js presentation given at La Crosse (LaX) Area Developers Club Meeting on July 23rd, 2024_** <br/>
On July 23rd, 2024 I had the opportunity to give a presentation on the basics of Node.js to the La Crosse Area Developers Club. At this event, I shared some of what I had learned about Node.js in my independent learning with other professional developers. I want to thank all the members who attended the meeting for my presentation! I also appreciated all of the valuable input everyone gave me on my presentation content.
